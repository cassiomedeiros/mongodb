      "I'm writing to demand that you disgorge the millions of dollars you intentionally made from fraudulently selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy, to funds such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.  You are a disgrace to the human race and I hope that you and your kind suffer the kind of punishment you really deserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "While you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.\n",

      "> Speaking of my travels...\n",
      "> This month I visited Johannesburg, South Africa, Dubai within the United\n",

      "> upgraded its billing systems to handle further expansion, and to date is\n",
      "> one of the world's largest Wildfire installations with some 21 AlphaServer\n",
      "> GS systems.  I also spent time with the management of Mobile Telephone\n",
      "> Networks (MTN), South Africa's #2 cellphone operator and another big\n",
